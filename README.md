# Sign2Text Web App

The Sign2Text web app is a bold initiative aimed at addressing communication barriers faced by individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Leveraging the power of engineering excellence, this innovative web application converts sign language gestures into text, facilitating a seamless and inclusive bridge of communication between sign language users and non-sign language users.

## Features

- Live video capture from a webcam using the OpenCV library.
- Hand gesture recognition and translation powered by advanced image processing techniques and the MediaPipe library.
- Preprocessing of captured frames for optimal analysis and feature extraction.
- Extraction of hand landmarks and features to characterize different gestures.
- Gesture recognition utilizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a labeled dataset of hand gestures using the scikit-learn library.

## Setup and Usage

To run the Sign2Text web app locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Start the application.
4. Access the web app through the provided URL.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform hand gestures and observe the recognized translations.

## Accuracy and Performance

The Sign2Text web app achieves high accuracy in recognizing hand gestures, providing reliable translations of sign language. Extensive performance optimizations ensure real-time processing and a smooth user experience.
